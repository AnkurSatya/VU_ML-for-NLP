    "Pandas is a module that provides data structures and is widely used for dealing with data representations in machine learning. It is a bit more advanced than the csv module we saw in the preprocessing notebook.\n",
    "Working with pandas data structures can be tricky, but it will generally work well if you follow online tutorials and examples closely. If your code is slow before you even started training your models, it is likely to be a problem with the way you are using Pandas (it will still work in most cases, you will just have to wait a bit longer). Once you are more used to working with modules and complex objects, it will also become easier to work with Pandas.\n",
